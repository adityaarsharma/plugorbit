## Why This Exists

Most WordPress plugin bugs that reach users fall into three categories:

1. **Code that was never wrong, just untested** — a widget that renders fine on the dev's machine breaks on PHP 8.2
2. **Performance regressions nobody noticed** — a new feature adds 40 extra DB queries per page load
3. **Design debt** — settings UI that confuses users because it was built dev-first, not user-first

This pipeline catches all three, automatically, before any release ships.

**What top teams do that most don't**:
- Automattic/WordPress VIP run every commit through PHP linting + VIP coding standards before merge
- 10up uses AI-powered visual regression testing — catching when something *looks* different without being *technically* broken
- WordPress.org plugin team added 15+ automated security checks in 2025 alone
- Leading Elementor addon teams run Playwright E2E suites across 3 WP versions before release

PlugOrbit brings that same discipline to any plugin team, with a single command.

## What It Checks

### For Developers

| Layer | What It Catches | Tools | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PHP Lint** | Fatal syntax errors, parse failures | `php -l` | 10s |
| **WordPress Standards** | Naming, escaping, nonces, capability checks, SQL injection | phpcs (WPCS + VIP) | 30s |
| **Static Analysis** | Type errors, undefined vars, dead code | PHPStan level 5 | 45s |
| **Security Scan** | XSS, CSRF, SQLi, auth bypass, path traversal | phpcs security sniffs | 30s |
| **Database Profiling** | N+1 queries, slow queries, autoload bloat | Query Monitor + MySQL | 2min |
| **Asset Weight** | JS/CSS bundle size, size regression per release | File analysis | 5s |
| **Compatibility** | PHP 7.4–8.3 × WP 6.3–latest | Local WP site variants + `php -l` | 5min |
| **i18n / POT** | Untranslated strings, missing text domains | `wp i18n make-pot` | 20s |

### For QA Testers

| Layer | What It Catches | Tools | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional Tests** | Broken features, admin panel errors, 404 assets | Playwright | 3min |
| **Visual Regression** | UI changes between releases (pixel diff) | Playwright snapshots | 2min |
| **Responsive Tests** | Mobile/tablet/desktop layout breaks | Playwright viewports | 2min |
| **Accessibility** | Color contrast, missing labels, keyboard nav | axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA) | 1min |
| **Console Errors** | JS errors specific to your plugin | Playwright | 1min |
| **Changelog Testing** | Maps each changelog entry to targeted test | `changelog-test.sh` | 1min |

### For Product Managers

No commands to memorize — read `reports/qa-report-{timestamp}.md` after every gauntlet run.

| Layer | What It Protects | Shown As | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Release Comparison** | "Did this release get worse or better?" | Score deltas (↑↓) | `scripts/compare-versions.sh` output |
| **Lighthouse Score** | User-facing speed and quality | 0–100 score | Gauntlet report |
| **Competitor Analysis** | "Are we ahead or behind?" | Side-by-side table of code quality, asset weight, update cadence | `reports/competitor-*.md` |
| **Pre-Release Checklist** | Sign-off gate before shipping | 60-point checklist | [checklists/pre-release-checklist.md](checklists/pre-release-checklist.md) |
| **UI/UX Checklist** | "Does this feel premium?" | 40-point checklist | [checklists/ui-ux-checklist.md](checklists/ui-ux-checklist.md) |
| **Changelog → Risk Map** | "What does this release change that could break?" | Test plan per changelog entry | `scripts/changelog-test.sh` |

**PM workflow**: before every release, open the latest gauntlet report + competitor report → check score deltas → sign off on the pre-release checklist. No terminal needed.

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — Interactive Setup (Recommended for First Time)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaarsharma/plugorbit
cd plugorbit
bash setup/init.sh
```

`init.sh` asks you 9 questions and creates `qa.config.json`:
- What type of plugin (Elementor addon / Gutenberg / SEO / WooCommerce / Theme)?
- Where is your source code?
- Who are your competitors? (auto-downloads and analyzes them)
- Do you have a Pro version to compare?
- Who uses this — dev, QA, or product team?

Every subsequent command reads from `qa.config.json` so you never repeat yourself.

### Option 2 — One-Liner (Skip Questions)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityaarsharma/plugorbit/main/setup/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 3 — Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaarsharma/plugorbit
cd plugorbit
bash setup/install.sh   # installs all tools
# Then configure qa.config.json manually (see structure below)
```

## Local WP — Required for Full Testing

### What Is Local WP and Why You Need It

Local WP (by Flywheel) is a free desktop app that runs a real WordPress environment on your Mac or Windows machine. Unlike WordPress Playground (browser-based), Local WP gives you:

- **Real MySQL 8.0 database** — required for DB query profiling, slow query logs
- **Real PHP 8.1** — catches issues that PHP simulators miss
- **Snapshots** — restore a clean database in 5 seconds before each test run
- **WP-CLI built in** — automate plugin installs, database resets from terminal
- **Multiple sites at once** — one per plugin under test

### Download the Right Version

**Download**: https://localwp.com → click **Download**

| Your Mac | Download |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4) | `Local-9.x.x-mac-arm64.dmg` |
| Intel Mac | `Local-9.x.x-mac-x64.dmg` |
| Windows | `Local-9.x.x-windows.exe` |

> Always use **Local 9.x** (current stable). Older versions have networking issues on modern macOS.

### Create Your Test Site

1. Open Local → click **+** (bottom left)
2. Site name: `tpa-test` (or your plugin name + `-test`)
3. Choose **Custom** environment:
   - PHP: **8.1**
   - Web server: **nginx**
   - MySQL: **8.0**
4. WordPress username: `admin` | Password: `password`
5. Click **Add Site**

Repeat for each plugin (e.g. `nexterwp-test`).

### First-Time Site Setup via WP-CLI

```bash
# Open the site shell in Local WP (right-click site → Open Site Shell)

# Install Query Monitor for DB profiling (required)
wp plugin install query-monitor --activate

# Install Elementor if testing an Elementor addon
wp plugin install elementor --activate

# Install your plugin
wp plugin install ~/Downloads/your-plugin.zip --activate --force

# Create a test page
wp post create --post_title="QA Test Page" --post_type=page --post_status=publish --post_name=qa-test
```

### Take a Clean Snapshot

After setup is complete, **before running any tests**:

1. Right-click site in Local → **Snapshots** → **Save Snapshot**
2. Name: `clean-v{version}` (e.g. `clean-v2.4.0`)

**Restore before every test run**: Right-click → Snapshots → Restore.
Takes 5 seconds. Guarantees a clean database with no test pollution.

### Enable MySQL Slow Query Log

Local WP → Click site → **Database** tab → toggle **Enable Slow Query Log** → threshold: `0.05s`

This logs any DB query taking over 50ms — essential for performance regression detection.

---

## Running the Pipeline

### Full Pre-Release Gauntlet

Run every layer before any release tag:

```bash
# Using qa.config.json (after init.sh)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh

# Manual with explicit paths
WP_TEST_URL=http://tpa-test.local \
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin ~/plugins/the-plus-addons --env local

# Quick mode (skips DB + Lighthouse — for fast developer iteration)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin ~/plugins/the-plus-addons --mode quick
```

Exit codes: `0` = all passed · `1` = failures found (do not release)

### Gauntlet Steps (What Runs in Order)

```
Step 1  PHP Lint           → syntax errors in every .php file
Step 2  PHPCS              → WordPress + VIP coding standards
Step 3  PHPStan            → static analysis (level 5)
Step 4  Asset Weight       → JS/CSS bundle sizes
Step 5  i18n / POT         → translatable strings + text domain check (wp-cli)
Step 6  Playwright Tests   → functional + visual regression
Step 7  Lighthouse         → Core Web Vitals scores
Step 8  DB Profiling       → query count + slow query log (local only)
```

### Changelog-Based Tests

When you update the CHANGELOG, automatically generate a targeted test plan:

```bash
bash scripts/changelog-test.sh --changelog ~/plugins/the-plus-addons/CHANGELOG.md

# Output: per-change test suggestions
# [NEW FEATURE] Added Mega Menu widget
#   → Test: Create a test page with Mega Menu → verify renders
#   → Test: Elementor editor → search "Mega Menu" → verify in panel
# [PERFORMANCE] Reduced DB queries on homepage
#   → Run: db-profile.sh and compare query count
# [SECURITY] Added nonce verification to AJAX handler
#   → Run: /wordpress-penetration-testing on changed file
```

### Competitor Analysis

Download and analyze competitor plugins automatically:

```bash
# Uses competitors from qa.config.json
bash scripts/competitor-compare.sh

# Or explicit
bash scripts/competitor-compare.sh --competitors "essential-addons-for-elementor-free,premium-addons-for-elementor"
```

What it pulls from each competitor:
- Version, active installs, rating, last updated
- JS/CSS bundle size (are they leaner than you?)
- PHPCS errors vs WordPress standards
- Security patterns (nonce usage, escaping, DB prepare)
- block.json adoption

### Version Comparison (Before vs After)

```bash
bash scripts/compare-versions.sh \
  --old ~/downloads/the-plus-addons-v2.3.zip \
  --new ~/downloads/the-plus-addons-v2.4.zip
```

Compares: PHPCS errors, bundle sizes, and sets up visual diff baseline.

## Playwright Tests — Browser Automation

### First Run — Auth Setup

```bash
WP_TEST_URL=http://tpa-test.local \
npx playwright test tests/playwright/auth.setup.js --project=setup
```

---

## Performance Testing

All performance testing runs locally with no external APIs required.

### Lighthouse CLI

```bash
# Full report (opens in browser)
lighthouse http://tpa-test.local \
  --output=html \
  --output-path=reports/lighthouse/report.html \
  --chrome-flags="--headless"

open reports/lighthouse/report.html

# Quick score
lighthouse http://tpa-test.local --output=json --quiet \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); \
    print('Performance:', int(d['categories']['performance']['score']*100), \
    '| A11y:', int(d['categories']['accessibility']['score']*100))"
```

### Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| Performance score | ≥ 80 | Overall weighted score |
| LCP | < 2.5s | When the main content loads |
| FCP | < 1.8s | When first content appears |
| TBT | < 200ms | JS blocking the main thread |
| CLS | < 0.1 | No layout jumps (content jumping around) |
| TTI | < 3.8s | When the page responds to user input |

### DB Query Profiling

```bash
WP_PATH="$HOME/Local Sites/tpa-test/app/public" \
WP_TEST_URL="http://tpa-test.local" \
TEST_PAGES="/,/qa-test/" \
bash scripts/db-profile.sh
```

Flags: query count >60/page, any query >100ms, N+1 patterns.

## Skill-Assisted Audits (Claude Code)

This pipeline integrates with Claude Code skills for deep AI-assisted analysis. See [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) for the full reference.

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Full security audit
claude "/wordpress-penetration-testing Audit ~/plugins/the-plus-addons for all OWASP vulnerabilities"

# Performance deep-dive
claude "/performance-engineer Find all N+1 queries in ~/plugins/the-plus-addons/includes/"

# Admin UI quality check
claude "/antigravity-design-expert Review admin UI in ~/plugins/the-plus-addons/admin/ for polish issues"

# 4 parallel audit agents (same as RankReady gauntlet)
claude "Run 4 parallel audits on ~/plugins/the-plus-addons:
1. /wordpress-plugin-development — WP standards
2. /wordpress-penetration-testing — security
3. /performance-engineer — performance
4. /database-optimizer — database
Merge findings by severity."
```

---

## Claude Code-Native (No CI Required)

PlugOrbit runs **locally, on demand, from Claude Code**. No GitHub Actions, no servers, no API keys, no secrets to manage. Every check is a `/skill` call or a `bash scripts/*.sh` invocation you trigger yourself.

**Why local-only?**
- WordPress plugin QA needs real MySQL, real PHP, real browsers — you have those on your Mac.
- CI drifts: tooling breaks silently, nobody fixes it, releases ship anyway. Local is inspectable.
- Claude Code with `/` commands is faster to iterate than CI logs.

**When you want automation later**, wire `bash scripts/gauntlet.sh` into your existing deploy pipeline — it exits 0 on pass, 1 on fail.

---

## Adding Tests for Your Plugin

1. Create: `tests/playwright/your-plugin/core.spec.js`
2. Copy structure from `tests/playwright/tpa/core.spec.js`
3. Replace admin URLs and CSS selectors with your plugin's
4. Create a Local WP test site (Step: Create Test Sites)
5. Run: `WP_TEST_URL=http://your-plugin.local npx playwright test tests/playwright/your-plugin/`

Minimal new test template:

```js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('my widget renders correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/my-test-page/');
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

  await expect(page.locator('.my-widget-class')).toBeVisible();

  // No JS errors from your plugin
  const errors = [];
  page.on('console', msg => { if (msg.type() === 'error') errors.push(msg.text()); });
  expect(errors.filter(e => e.includes('my-plugin'))).toHaveLength(0);

  // Visual snapshot (first run creates baseline; subsequent runs diff)
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('my-widget.png', { maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.02 });
});
```

---

## Report Output

Every gauntlet run creates `reports/qa-report-{timestamp}.md`. Example:

```

---

## Test Site Automation — Two Paths

### Path A — Local WP (recommended for manual QA + rich DX)

Local WP's site creation is **GUI-only** — you have to click through the app to create the site once. After that, PlugOrbit automates everything via WP-CLI.

See [docs/local-wp-setup.md](docs/local-wp-setup.md) for exact click-through steps.

**Good for**: daily manual testing, Query Monitor workflow, visually inspecting DB state.

### Path B — `@wordpress/env` (fully automated, Docker-based)

One command creates a fresh WP test site with your plugin pre-installed:

```bash
bash scripts/create-test-site.sh --plugin ~/plugins/my-plugin --port 8881
# → http://localhost:8881 ready in 30 seconds, no clicks needed
```

**Good for**: CI-style isolated testing, fresh-state tests, multi-version matrix (run one site per PHP/WP combo).

### Path C — `wp-now` (instant, no Docker)

Run from any plugin folder:

```bash
cd ~/plugins/my-plugin && wp-now start
# → instant WP with your plugin loaded, zero config
```

**Good for**: quick sanity checks, isolated widget tests.

---

## The `plugins/` Drop Box

PlugOrbit has a `plugins/` folder for comparison runs and competitor analysis:

```
plugins/
├── free/     # Auto-downloaded free zips (from wordpress.org)
└── pro/      # You manually drop Pro / paid zips here
```

**Pull every free plugin slug from your config**:

```bash
bash scripts/pull-plugins.sh
# Reads qa.config.json "competitors" → downloads latest zips → saves to plugins/free/<slug>/
```

**For Pro zips**: download from your vendor account, drop into `plugins/pro/`, reference in `qa.config.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": {
    "proZip": "plugins/pro/my-plugin-pro-2.4.zip"
  }
}
```

Full details: [plugins/README.md](plugins/README.md).

## Roadmap — How PlugOrbit Gets Better

PlugOrbit is designed to grow. Tracked ideas:

### Near-term
- [ ] **Plugin Check integration** — run [WordPress/plugin-check](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check) as Step 9 of gauntlet (mirrors wordpress.org submission checks)
- [ ] **Mutation testing** — via Infection PHP to catch weak tests
- [ ] **Release note auto-generator** — from Playwright diffs + changelog, produce a marketable changelog
- [ ] **Multi-site matrix testing** — run gauntlet across `PHP × WP × WooCommerce` combinations via wp-env
- [ ] **Translation coverage report** — per-locale .mo file freshness check

### Medium-term
- [ ] **WPScan CVE check** — wire into gauntlet as a security gate
- [ ] **Memory profiling** — Xdebug + cachegrind integration for "which hook is slow"
- [ ] **REST API fuzzer** — auto-discover + fuzz every `register_rest_route` call
- [ ] **Gutenberg block.json linter** — strict validation against current WP standards
- [ ] **Visual diff UI** — web viewer for pixel diffs beyond Playwright's HTML reporter

### Long-term
- [ ] **Claude Code Skill: `/plugorbit-audit`** — one skill that orchestrates the full gauntlet
- [ ] **VS Code extension** — run any PlugOrbit script from the editor's command palette
- [ ] **Release gate bot** — comment on PRs with a pass/fail grid
- [ ] **Public benchmark dashboard** — community-submitted competitor scores, kept fresh

### Contribute an idea

## Contributing / Extending

This repo is designed to grow. Good contributions:
- New Playwright templates for plugin types (tests/playwright/templates/)
- Plugin-type-specific PHPCS rule additions
- Additional competitor analysis metrics
- Performance regression rules
- New skill invocation patterns in SKILLS.md
- New power tools worth installing (docs/power-tools.md)

Keep it research-first. If adding a check: link to the standard or incident that motivated it.

## Philosophy

PlugOrbit follows three rules:

1. **Build from config, not hardcoded paths.** Everything reads `qa.config.json`. A config-less run is a smoke test.
2. **Local-first, not CI-first.** Real MySQL, real PHP, real browsers — already on your Mac. CI is optional plumbing.
3. **Agents over scripts, when useful.** Claude Code skills are the senior reviewer; scripts are the junior QA.
